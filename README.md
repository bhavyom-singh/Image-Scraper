# Image-Scraper

This is a simple but intelligent image scraper.
All you need to do is to run the script and enter the website url or the link of the image with jpg(jpeg) or png extension then hit enter.
You will get all the images at a specific location that you set in the script.
It will also delete those images with width and height lower than 500px.
I made this project with the thought of making those images,my laptop wallpaper but it can be used alot more scenarios.
